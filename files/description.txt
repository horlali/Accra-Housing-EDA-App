This project faces several constraints and opportunities. There are not so many well-known or 
readily available datasets to help study the accommodation phenomenon to arrive at the goal 
described above. To complete the project in full, we need to obtained data about accommodation in 
Ghana. One option is to look online for services that provide information that can be collected into a 
database. Since several e-commerce sites provide listings for various kinds of accommodation across 
the country, I considered scraping the web and building a suitable dataset for the analysis. The 
dataset was obtained from https://www.meqasa.com.
