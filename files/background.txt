The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals includes a target for making cities and human
settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable (Goal 11). A key outcome of this goal is to
provide opportunities for safe and affordable housing. The housing situation in Ghana is far from
the SDG target described above. As a result, it would be interesting to investigate the housing
situation in Ghana and provide an understanding of the housing situation. The goal of this project
therefore, is to use such an understanding to provide a description of places in the country that
provide the best options for budget accommodation. The insights from this project can be useful
for not only policy makers, but also for young people making the decision to move to some part
of the country to start their working lives.
